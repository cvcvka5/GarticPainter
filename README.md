# ðŸŽ¨GarticPainter

**GarticPainter** is an advanced automated drawing tool designed specifically for the online multiplayer drawing game **Gartic Phone**. It captures a selected screen region, converts images to Garticâ€™s limited color palette, and uses simulated mouse actions to draw pixel-perfect recreations on the game canvas. The tool supports color matching with CIEDE2000 for accuracy and allows stopping the drawing anytime by pressing 'q'.
